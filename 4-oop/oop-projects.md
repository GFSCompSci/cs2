## OOP Practice

### These are some ideas to practice Object Oriented Programming.

Exercises:

  1. Bank Account - Jalapeno

  Make a class BankAccount where instances of accounts can be created. Give these objects variables such as account number, account owner,
  and account balance. Create methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.

  2. Parking Garage - Cayenne
  
  Create two classes Car and Garage.

  For the Car class initialize the objects with owner name, and a registration number. Other variables can include make, model, etc.
  Initialize the Garage class with a name for the garage and a total number of spots. Create method to "park" Car objects in the garage.
  Make sure you can't park more cars than spots available!

  3. Whackamole! - Habanero

  Create a Whackamole game using a single class "Whackamole".

  Initialize variables for grid size (should be a square grid), number of whacking attempts, and total moles left.
  Create methods to create the grid (and place moles), and whack moles (using user input).
  Also create methods to view the grid, either as a player (doesn't reveal unwhacked moles), or as an administrator (reveals entire grid).

  4. Battleship - Ghost Pepper

  Create the game battleship using classes.
