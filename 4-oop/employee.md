Employee Directory Exercise

Step 1. Create an Employee class
* Give it a "__init__" function that takes name and salary as self variables.
* Use a class variable to keep track of total employees, increment it each time an employee is created.
* Create "displayCount" and "displayEmployee" functions to display the amount of employees and employee name/salary respectively.

Step 2. Modify Your class
* Create at least two different jobs for your employees (I used manager/clerk)
* Add job as a self variable
* Use class variables to keep track of how many employees have each job

Step 3. Create a Directory Program
* Use a while loop to create a directory program with user input (similar to your phonebook)
* Use your employee class to create employees
* Hint: You can append objects to a list!
