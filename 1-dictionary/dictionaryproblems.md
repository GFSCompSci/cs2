1. Write a Python script to add key to a dictionary.

	Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}
	Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

2. Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one.

	Sample Dictionary :
	dic1={1:10, 2:20}
	dic2={3:30, 4:40}
	dic3={5:50,6:60}
	Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

3. Write a Python script to check if a given key already exists in a dictionary.

4. Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops.

5. Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.

6. Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are square of keys. 
Sample Dictionary
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}
